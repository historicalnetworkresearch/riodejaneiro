# Organization

## Research Community
The [Historical Network Research Community](https://historicalnetworkresearch.org/) brings together researchers interested in the application of network analysis to historical disciplines. In addition to the [HNR Conference and HNR Workshops](https://historicalnetworkresearch.org/hnr-events/), it publishes the [Journal of Historical Network Research](https://jhnr.uni.lu/index.php/jhnr/index) and compiles a collaborative [bibliography](https://historicalnetworkresearch.org/bibliography/).
